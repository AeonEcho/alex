# ALEX!
## Play jeopardy with your friends!

This bot has exactly one purpose and exactly one feature.

**Just use ".q" (sans quotes) for a question.** Answer within a time limit. That simple!

We use pretty permissive fuzzy string matching to validate answersâ€”this means you'll likely get credit for questions you got incorrect every now and then.

This bot is developed and maintained for free by a student (me!). It is entirely open-source, and I will never develop a "pro" or "premium" version that costs money. I pay for hosting out of pocket. If you're enjoying the bot, please consider donating to support the bot's continued development and hosting costs.
